# Problem
The unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by surprise and left businesses including healthcare clinics and surgery centers scrambling to find new solutions in light of the crisis. 

There is no comprehensive solution in the market for smooth and safe check-in for the patients going to physicians’ appointments and avoiding crowded waiting rooms.

# Solution
Checkincar is a novel solution to keep patients and staff as safe as possible by providing safe check-in in the car, thereby avoiding the crowding of the clinic wait rooms. 

**As part of this solution, the patients are able to checkin for their appointment from their cars when 2 criteria are met:**
1. Within 15 minutes (can be changed per physician practice’s preference) of their appointment time.
2. When the car is within a half mile (i.e around parking lot) (can be changed as per location specifics) distance of the clinic. This will be via google maps/uber type software.

**This allows patients to:**
1. Wait in their vehicles until they receive a notification text that it is their turn to be seen.
2. Fill up their virtual paperwork in our hipaa compliant software while waiting in the car. 
3. Pay their copay for the visit upfront through the app minimizing their contact time with office staff and other patients while they are in the office
